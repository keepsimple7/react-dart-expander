     * Hello,
     *
     * This is the HTML portion of the tutorial for the Dart react package.
     *
     * We'll go through a simple app that queries the Google Maps API and shows the result to the user.
     * It also stores the search history and allows the user to reload past queries.
     *
     * In this file you'll find the mount point of the app. There is also a `geocodes.dart` file which contains the
     * structure and the application logic.
     *
     * Be sure that you understand the basic concepts of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before reading this
     * tutorial.
     *
     * Enjoy!
