# js_interop_helpers_test

The same Dart tests in `shared_tests.dart` are run using the different HTML files in this directory.

These HTML files import different combinations of the different consumable React JS files exposed by this package,
testing that they all include the JS functions (`_getProperty`/`_setProperty`) needed by `react_client/js_interop_helpers.dart`.

That way, if the JS files get updated and those JS functions get accidentally deleted, we'll know about it.
